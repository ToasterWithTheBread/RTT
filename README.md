This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is it
A simple program to quickly send a file to multiple clients at the same time

## How to run
I (personally) use Coolify, so I load the repo and select the Next.js template, for Docker you just need to download the repo and build the container from the Dockerfile the same way you would with anything, there are no Enviroment Variables, and the only
port that needs to be open is port 3000 (inside the container)

## Contributing
Everything is welcome, I will try to review everything as quick as possible when I can, if you have a pressing matter just message me on Telegram at @ToasterWithTheBread
